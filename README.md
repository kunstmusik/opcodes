# Csound Opcodes 

This project contains Csound opcodes written in Csound orchestra code as
user-defined opcodes (UDOs) or in C.

## Project Format

UDOs are organised into files with the .udo extension. Each .udo file contains
only one primary UDO and utility UDOs. UDOs are organised by topic within the udo folder.  

C opcodes are organised within the c folder. 

Tests for opcodes are written as CSD's within the tests folder.
