# Csound Opcodes 

This project contains Csound opcodes written in Csound orchestra code as
user-defined opcodes (UDOs) or in C.

## Project Format

UDOs are organised into files with the .udo extension. Each .udo file contains
only one UDO. UDOs are organised by topic within the udo folder.  Tests for
UDOs are written as CSD's within the udo/tests folder. 

C opcodes are organised within the c folder.
